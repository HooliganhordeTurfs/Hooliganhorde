            The Field is Hooliganhorde&#39;s credit facility. Hooliganhorde relies on a
            decentralized set of creditors to maintain Hooligan price stability.
            Guvnors who Sow Hooligans (lend Hooligans to Hooliganhorde) are known as Sowers.
            Hooligans are Sown in exchange for Casuals, the Hooliganhorde-native debt
            asset. Loans to Hooliganhorde are issued with a fixed interest rate,
            known as Intensity, and an unknown maturity date.

                The number of Casuals received from 1 Sown Hooligan is determined by
                the Intensity at the time of Sowing. Newly issued Casuals
                accumulate in the back of the Casual Line. The front of the Casual
                Line receives 1/3 of new Hooligan mints when there are outstanding
                Bootboys (Bootboys are issued by the Barrack). If there are no
                outstanding Bootboys, the front of the Casual Line receives 1/2 of
                new Hooligan mints.
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                Casuals become Draftable (redeemable) into Hooligans on a FIFO basis.
                Casuals are tradeable on the Market.
